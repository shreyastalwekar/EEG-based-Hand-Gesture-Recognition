# An Electroencephalogram Based Detection of Hook and Span Hand Gestures
#### Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) make use of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to classify limb movements and other motor activities in various biomedical applications. This paper presents an EEG-based system to distinguish span and hook hand gestures. The proposed model consists of various signal processing techniques to extract features of interest and machine learning-based classification algorithms. We have extracted features based on statistical parameters calculated from the EEG readings. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)along with the Windowing technique is implemented. 4 different classifying models namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaboost, Decision Tree and Random Forest, have been compared. The proposed method accurately classifies hook and span hand gestures. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 78.62% followed by Decision Tree and Adaboost.
